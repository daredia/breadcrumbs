- chrome extensions run as a local website that cant launch a server or external storage, but it can communicate with remote servers
- chrome extensions cannot execute inline js, so angular would be a bit tricky
- chrome extensions are a bit sandboxed, the popup cant communicate with chrome's APIs directly but it can communicate with a background page, and that background page can talk to chrome APIs
