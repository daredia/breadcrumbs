TODOs:
- figure out why some html isnt being downloaded
- set chron job
- grab and display favicons for each linkItem
- add 'clear' button to reset view rather than having to submit a blank query
- handle sending and receiving multiple linkItems in POST request, not just 1
- migrate serverside code to separate repo instead of web historian
- ignore certain sites (gmail, etc)


- DONT FORGET TO refresh the github readme page before demoing breadcrumbs
- chrome extensions run as a local website that cant launch a server or external storage, but it can communicate with remote servers
- chrome extensions cannot execute inline js, so using angular is a bit tricky
- chrome extensions are a bit sandboxed, the popup cant communicate with chrome's APIs directly but it can communicate with a background page, and that background page can talk to chrome APIs
- the extension keys off of your chrome history, so even if you sometimes use a browser that doesnt have the extension (like say a pairing station or on your phone), using the extension later will still be able to search that history
