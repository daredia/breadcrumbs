  > Find that page you saw that one time

Can't find that link your friend sent you last week? Was it on Slack? Email? You read that blog post and didn't bother to bookmark it because... who does that, right? But now you want to refer back to it again and Google's showing you a million results that aren't the one you're looking for. Your browser history isn't helping because you don't remember the title or url of the page, just some keywords in the text. 

Enter Breadcrumbs. Save the content of all your browsing activity and easily search it later to find that page you saw that one time. 

## How to Get Started ##
- Install the Breadcrumbs Chrome extension
- Sign into Google Chrome on all your devices
- Browse the web as you normally do

That's it! Next time you want to find a page you previously visited, click the Breadcrumbs icon in your browser and run a search.
